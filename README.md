# Social Media Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview
This data engineering project focuses on providing insights and comparisons between a company product and its competitors on social media platformsâ€”Twitter, Twitch, and YouTube. By leveraging social media data from these platforms, this project aims to visualize trends, engagement metrics, and overall social media presence to support business decision-making.

The project integrates several data sources, including the Twitter API, Google API V3, and Sullygnome (for Twitch data), to collect real-time and historical data. The collected data is processed and transformed using Python and Pandas, and presented in an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for easy client access and decision-making.

## Data Sources
- **Twitter**: Data is collected using the Twitter API to monitor engagement metrics, such as tweets, retweets, and likes for both the company product and its competitors.
- **Twitch**: The project pulls Twitch data via Sullygnome, an online service that provides data and statistics for Twitch streams.
- **YouTube**: Data for YouTube is gathered using the Google API V3, providing insights into video performance metrics, including views, likes, comments, and more.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Social Media Monitoring**: Collects and analyzes data from Twitter, Twitch, and YouTube.
- **Data Pipeline**: Uses Python and Pandas to clean, process, and transform raw social media data into actionable insights.
- **Data Visualization**: The processed data is displayed in interactive charts and graphs using Streamlit.
  - **Line Charts**: For tracking trends over time (e.g., number of tweets, likes, retweets).
  - **Pie Charts**: For visualizing proportions and comparisons between different metrics.
  - **Bar Charts**: For comparing metrics between the company product and its competitors.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data collection, processing, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and transformation.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive web dashboard.
- **Plotly**: For interactive data visualizations.
- **Twitter API**: To gather data about tweets, likes, and retweets.
- **Google API V3**: For gathering YouTube video data.
- **Sullygnome**: For obtaining Twitch statistics and data.

## Features Walkthrough

### Twitter Share of Voice
- **Line Chart**: Visualizes the trend of tweets, retweets, and likes over time for both the company product and its competitors.
- **Pie Chart**: Compares the share of tweets, retweets, and likes between different competitors.
- **Bar Chart**: Provides a stacked bar chart of tweets, retweets, and likes by game or competitor.

### Twitch Data Insights
- **View Count**, **Like Count**, and **Comment Count**: Track and visualize the growth and performance of streams over time.

### YouTube Data Insights
- **Views**, **Likes**, and **Comments**: Monitor the performance of videos, with comparisons between the company product's channel and competitors.

## Future Improvements
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Implement real-time data collection and dashboard updates.
